# Digital Humanities: Tools and Methods - Assignment 1







**1. Specify a topic on which you'd like to work in the following weeks (don't worry, you can change it later on)**


The topic I would like to explore is the use of Twitter hashtag (#APEC2022) in political activism and how users are spreading political awareness in Thailand.


**2. Provide some context for the topic, citing existing research (theoretical, interpretative, and/or empirical) that makes some testable claims**

Throughout history Thailand has always been facing national political crisis, where violence would breakout during protests due to polarization of political opinions as well as having an unstable government system (Asiafoundation.org, 2017). The latest coup occurred in Thailand back in 2014 as the military seized power from the previous prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra (Asiafoundation.org, 2017). Thailand remain under the military regime and in 2016 a new constitution was written (Asiafoundation.org, 2017). Subsequently, the general Prayuth Chan-ocha who was the leader in the military became the prime minister (Kongkirati & Kanchoochat, 2018). The reasoning that this was possible because the new constitution allows the army to have access to institutional power (Kongkirati & Kanchoochat, 2018). This led to military elites abusing these powers to construct ways to seize power without remaining in a coup (Kongkirati & Kanchoochat, 2018). In this current time Thailand is still fighting for freedom, democracy and to escape the semi-authoritarianism. 

With the rise of social media, political activism and spreading awareness of certain issues around the world has been more popular due to the access and availability. For this reason, I would like to look at hashtag activism on Twitter. For example, Social Media and Hashtag Activism by Manash Pratim Goswami, illustrates how hashtag activism was used in the case study of Kony 2012 (Goswami, 2018). The term hashtag activism was mentioned on The Guardian in 2011, where the idea of it is to unite communities, coordinate campaigns and instigate gatherings that may lead to social or political changes (Goswami, 2018).

Lastly, I would like to focus on #APEC2022 because APEC stands for The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation established in 1989 (APEC, n.d.). However, this year it is being held in Bangkok Thailand (APEC, n.d.). Therefore, with many countries gathering together in Thailand, the citizens may think it is a great opportunity to spread awareness by utilizing #APEC2022.

**3. Formulate at least one research question (RQ) and/or hypothesis**

To what extent are Twitter users utilising #APEC2022 to spread political awareness in relation to state crimes In Thailand? 



**4. Explaining how you think you can explore the proposed topic and address the RQs**


I would like to scrape data from Twitter through a Twitter API and focusing on #APEC2022. I would like to collect a certain amount of the top posts in a certain timeframe. Subsequently, I will count the amount of posts thematically, for example, state crime, APEC, memes and so on. Furthermore, I will relate my findings to concepts such as political activism. 



**5. Describe what kind of data you need to answer your RQs and/or test your hypothesis**

The types of data that I will be collecting includes the amount of repost and construct a coding schema to identify which posts falls under which themes. I would personally want to focus of specific words or visuals in order to make it easier to code the themes.



**6. If you know any, mention tools and/or methods that you could use**

I will be using Twitter Api, Netlytics to scrape data in relation to the (#APEC2022). The downside of Netlytic is the fact that it could only scrape data up to seven days. Therefore, I would have to set an appropriate timeframe. Furthermore, I will organise the raw data from Netlytic into Excel as a cvs file in order to include what is necessary for my research. However, for visualisation of the data I am unsure as I do not have a lot experience. This being said, I would like to try to use pandas or seaborn in Jupyter notebook or other tools that we will be exploring in these upcoming weeks.
